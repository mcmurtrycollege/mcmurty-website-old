# This is a title.

This is an announcement.

## This is a Subtitle

Here's how you add a post:

1. If you're reading this, that means you're already on the Github. Navigate to the _posts folder and click on NEW FILE. 
2. Filename should be in the format of 'MM-DD-YYYY-title.md'. For example: 02-15-2016-sample.md
3. You can follow the format of this page to write the body of the post. (There are some more markdown tips further down)
4. Once done, there should be a 'Commit New File' option. The first input box is a description -- this is necessary. You can follow the format 'posted [title of post]'. Leave the radio button at 'Commit directly to master'. You should now be able to click 'Commit new file'. 
5. You're done! Celebrate!

## Markdown Tips

This is how you create a bulleted list (all three are identical, so take your pick):
* Bullet Item
+ Bullet Item
- Bullet Item

To create a numbered list, just do numbers with a period after.

1. This
2. Is
3. A
4. Numbered List

There are 6 levels of headers. The more hashtags, the smaller.
# Largest
## Largish
### Medium
#### Smaller
##### Smallish
###### Smallist
