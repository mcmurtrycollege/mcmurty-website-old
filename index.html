		<p> McMurtry College is home to the Murts, a diverse collection of students coming from all walks of life. Whether you are a musi, archi, engineer or academ, there’s a place for you within the walls of McMurtry. Murts are a tight-knit family who can often to be seen eating, playing, studying and dodging ceiling tiles together. Fierce in spirit and amazing in everything else, being a Murt is not just a transient college title but a way of life. </p>
		<p> We rally to the call of the conch, and despite being the second youngest college, have a thriving culture revolving around our Scottish heritage, love of bananas, and general awesomeness. </p>
